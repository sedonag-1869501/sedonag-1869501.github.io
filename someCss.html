 <p class="a"> My name is Sedona Gallagher. I am from Henderson, Nevada and I am a junior here at the UW. I am an English major, and I am taking this class because many people recommended it to me and said it was quite fun.</p>

 <p class="b"> I have one dog named Dougie,and he is quite a rowdy fellow. I have no siblings; I grew up as an only child playing tennis with my parents. Now, I play tennis for UW! It is quite stressful at times to manage both sports and academics at once, but I am hoping that at the end of the day it will be worth it.</p>

 <h1>Some Resized Pictures: (my third CSS element that wasn't mentioned in the workshop is this red dotted border. So fun!</h1>
